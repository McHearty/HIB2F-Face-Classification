# Face Classification Add-On for Blender

## Overview
The Face Classification Add-On for Blender is designed to enhance the HI:B2F workflow in Blender, specifically for users working with complex triangulated mesh objects. This tool classifies the faces of all selected mesh objects, providing valuable insights and aiding in the conversion of triangulated meshes into forge triangles.
## Compatibility
- Blender Version: 3.3.1

## Installation
1. Download the `FaceClassification.py` file.
2. Open Blender and navigate to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`.
3. Click on `Install` and select the downloaded file.
4. Enable the add-on by checking the box next to its name.

## Usage
Once installed, the add-on can be accessed from the `View3D > Sidebar` in Blender. To use the add-on:
1. Select the mesh objects you wish to classify.
2. Execute the operator to classify the faces of the selected meshes.
3. The total counts of different classifications across all selected objects will be accumulated and displayed.

## Integration with Mesh-to-Forge-Objects
This add-on works in conjunction with the [Mesh-to-Forge-Objects](https://github.com/Yolomcswag/Mesh-to-Forge-Objects) tool, enhancing the workflow for converting triangulated meshes into forge triangles for "Halo Infinite". The combined usage of these tools allows for a streamlined process from mesh classification to object forging.
